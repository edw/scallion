# Scallion: a configuration tool

`environ` is a great package, but I needed something that would work
pretty much like it, but would consult an `etcd` server for a value
before consulting environment variables, etc.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[edw/scallion "0.1.0"]]
```

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[scallion.core :refer [env]])

(env :myapp-security-token) ;; Looks for $MYAPP_SECURITY_TOKEN env var
                            ;; or myapp.security.token Java property or
                            ;; myapp-security-token in your lein env iff
                            ;; myapp/security/token key is not found in
                            ;; an accessible etcd instance.
```

There may be a slight delay the first time your code fetches a value
using the `env` function, because Scallion checks to see if an `etcd`
server is running on either `127.0.0.1` or `172.17.42.1`--or both. The
first is the address on which a local `etcd` server will be running
whereas the latter is the default IP address from which `etcd` is
accessible to processes running inside Docker container under CoreOS.

Scallion will consult an `etcd` instance running on `127.0.0.1` before
one running on `172.17.42.1`, the rationale being that if both are
present, it's running locally for a reason.

Scallion will, if `etcd` is not available, will look inside
`environ.core/env`. Note that `environ.core/env` is a map, whereas
`scallion.core/env` is a function. Also, because the issue of
embedding security keys and so forth in source code is such a serious
one, there is no two-argument form of the function, making it more
difficult for programmers to embed default values in source code.

Since Scallion consults a web service for each key value, you should
not call it `env` repeatedly for the same key.
